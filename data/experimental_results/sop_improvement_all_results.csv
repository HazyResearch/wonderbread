- Steps use general terminology like ""scroll down"" rather than specific scroll distances

The main improvements over the previous version are:

- More precise element descriptions (""profile avatar"" instead of ""picture"")
- Breaking out replacing the URL text into two steps (click field, then type)
- Removing any redundant actions (e.g. multiple clicks on same field)
- Using more concise terminology (e.g. ""dropdown menu"" instead of ""options shown"")

","# Updated Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

To determine the total amount spent on shopping at One Stop Market in November 2022 with a 20% discount applied for orders exceeding $200 paid in cash, follow these steps:

1. Click on the 'My Account' link located at the top right corner of the One Stop Market homepage.
2. In the account navigation menu on the left side, click on the 'My Orders' link.
3. If the orders from November 2022 are not immediately visible, click on the pagination control labeled 'Next' at the bottom of the order list to navigate through the pages.
4. Locate the order(s) with a date in November 2022 and click on the 'View Order' link for each order to see its details.
5. For each order, scroll down to the 'Order Information' section to check the 'Grand Total' and 'Payment Method'.
6. If the 'Payment Method' indicates cash payment and the 'Subtotal' before any discounts is greater than $200, calculate the discounted total by reducing the 'Grand Total' by 20%.
7. Note down the discounted 'Grand Total' for each qualifying order.
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 for each order in November 2022.
9. Add up the noted discounted 'Grand Total' amounts from all qualifying orders to find the total amount spent with the discount applied.

Edge Case Considerations:
- If you do not see the orders from November 2022, ensure you navigate through all pages using the pagination controls.
- If an order does not specify a cash payment method, it does not qualify for the 20% discount.
- If the subtotal of an order is $200 or less, the 20% discount does not apply.
- If you encounter any issues with viewing order details, ensure that you are logged into your account and have the necessary permissions to view the orders. If the problem persists, contact customer support for assistance.",1,1,True,True,True,GPT4,1--True--True--True--GPT4
